I am a PhD student at MIT in the computer science (EECS) department, with an interest in parallel algorithms. My advisor is Prof. Julian Shun.

I graduated from Cornell University with a double major in Computer Science and Operations Research. I worked on studying the structures and tagging behaviors of online forum communities like StackExchange.com with Professor Austin Benson, and on modeling the volume of Spotify's music streams with the Cornell Operations Research Applied Learning (CORAL) team under the supervision of Professor Jamol Pender. I have also worked on analyzing the Citibike bike-sharing system with Professor David Shmoys.

### Research
My current research focuses on parallel clustering frameworks. In the past, I have also been interested in data mining and network science.

### Intern

I interned at the New York Times in summer 2018!

### Teaching

I was a teaching assistant for the following courses at Cornell:

[CS 4780: Machine Learning for Intelligent Systems](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4780/2018sp/)
